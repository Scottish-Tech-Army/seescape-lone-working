# User instructions

## Instructions for office staff

All data is stored in a Microsoft 365 (Outlook) calendar of a user specifically configured for the purpose, the "central" user.

- Every lone worker must be assigned a user ID number.

- Every appointment that should be checked in and out should be added to the central calendar. The body of the appointment should contain the user identifier in the format "ID:###" where "###" is the user ID number of the worker in question.

- When a lone worker checks in or out of a meeting, an Outlook category "Checked-In" or "Checked-Out" respectively is added to the calendar appointment.

    - If a lone worker fails to make this call on time, the categories can be manually added (such as if the worker phones up to report that a meeting ended so early they cannot check out yet), or there is an error.

- There are a number of error scenarios which lead to emails to a configured emergency email address (which may be distribution list).

    - If a user fails to check in or out within 15 minutes of the specified time. In this case an extra "Missed-Check-In" or "Missed-Check-Out" category is added to the appointment.

    - If a user selects the emergency option, then an email is also sent.
