# Operations processes

*This is still rather basic, but gets the key ideas across.*

## Upgrading to new version of code

In order to take a new version of the code, you should follow the process below.

- Check out the code from the [github repo](https://github.com/Scottish-Tech-Army/seescape-lone-working), and `cd` intot he root directory.

- Load your config file.

    ~~~bash
    . config/whatever_env.sh
    ~~~

- Build and push your code

    ~~~bash
    bash scripts/code_build.sh test && bash scripts/code_push.sh
    ~~~

- Validate that the code is working manually, following the steps below.

## Validation and testing

### Validating credentials

*TODO: add the test script that checks that all the right permissions are set up.*

### Validating the lambda functions

This checks that the lambda functions are doing what they should be doing.

- Log into the AWS console, and find Lambda functions (enter `lambda` in the search bar if necessary).

- To validate the `check` function works:

    - Select `CheckFunction`

    - Click the `Test` button

    - Ensure that the response looks reasonable, and check the logs (linked to from that page)

    - Repeat after setting up some meetings that should trigger mails (obviously, make sure you do not cause a panic when you do this).

- To validate the `connect` function works:

    - Select `ConnectFunction`

    - Set up three inputs (if they do not already exist). These can all look something like the example below - with "buttonpressed" taking the value 1, 2, 3 for checkin / checkout / emergency. You should ensure that the mobile number matches a real mobile number.

    ~~~json
    {
        "Details": {
            "Parameters": {
            "buttonpressed": "1"
            },
            "ContactData": {
                "CustomerEndpoint": {
                    "Address": "+447123123456"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ~~~

    - Click the `Test` button

    - Ensure that the response looks reasonable, and check the logs (linked to from that page)

    - Set up some real meetings and make sure that checkin / checkout / emergency calls work.

### End to end testing

*TODO: largely just calling in and seeing if it works.*

## Routine operations

### Monitoring

You can find logs, dashboards and metrics under CloudWatch.

- Log into the AWS console.

- Go to CloudWatch (enter `CloudWatch` in the search bar if necessary).

- The dashboard is named with the value of `${APP}`, which is normally `loneworker`. This shows how many calls to the Lambda functions of different types have occurred.

- You should also be able to find logs for all calls to the lambda functions.

### Costs

This costs money to run. Roughly the cost implications are as follows.

- There is no additoinal cost to the M365 tenant; shared mailboxes are free, and so are emails.

- AWS costs are a little more complicated.

    - In AWS the predominant cost is that of the lambda function running with provisioned concurrency. If the provisioned concurrency is set to 1 in configuration (as recommended), then the cost is around $15 (so perhaps Â£12) per month.

    - Each phone call incurs a cost of $0.038 per minute (minimum billing period one minute). If you have 5 staff who make 20 calls per week, and are taking the cost of having a freephone number, then that is around $16 per month - so very comparable to the cost of the lambda provisioning.

    - There are other costs for storage, configuration and so on. These are low enough to be insignificant compared to the above two.
