# Operations processes

*This is very much a work in progress; some basic notes.*

## Upgrading to new version of code

*TODO: In principle just running build.sh, but the script needs cleaning up.*

## Burndown

*TODO: how do we get to a clean state afterwards*

## Backup

*TODO: do we need a backup strategy? We may not need one if everything is reproducible in code*

# Logs / metrics / whatever ...

*TODO: write up diagnostics process*
